# OpenKattisJava
A simple remote repository for my Java submissions for Open.Kattis' competition programming problems.

This repository is a remote way to store and access my Java files and projects meant to be solutions for some of the competition programming
problems featured on open.kattis.com. Most problems require a single java file (located in the src folder), which was originally from an IntelliJ
project folder.
